          I'm Software Developer that evolved from Quality Engineer with total
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anks/" target="_blank"
            >10+ years of experience in IT and its close surroundings</a
          >. I mostly do Elixir and Ruby. Based in Poznań, Poland.

          At some point, I might have had an account on every major website. The Internet is my
          life, also professionally – I majored in e-business (M.Sc: "Application of OpenId in
          e-administration" – yes, it was a thing in 2010, this is what ePUAP is about) and law
          (M.Sc. in software patents), I helped establish one of the first e-book stores in Poland,
          <a href="http://fanpoint.com/" target="_blank">I used to click a lot on FB</a>, and later
          started hunting for software bugs
          <a href="http://netguru.co/" target="_blank">here</a>
          <a href="http://recruitee.com/" target="_blank">and there</a>. In 2020 I finally switched
          my job to a full time backend developer. I've also dabbled in photography, doing some
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/anksfoto/" target="_blank">wedding</a> and
          <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/anksfoto/" target="_blank">amateur</a> gigs along
          the way. <a href="https://www.dareit.io/" target="_blank">Mentoring people</a> gives me
          fuel for existence.

          In my free time I enjoy
          <a href="https://goodreads.com/matisnape" target="_blank">reading</a>,
          <a href="https://letterboxd.com/ankss/" target="_blank">watching</a>
          <a href="http://www.imdb.com/user/ur25723075" target="_blank">movies</a>, cycling (3 bikes
          in da house), running (love & hate relationship) and a random parade of handcraft stuff
          among the years.
