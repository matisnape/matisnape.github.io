    <h1>Hi, I'm Anks</h1>

    <p>
      I'm Software Developer that evolved from Quality Engineer with total
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anks/" target="_blank"
        >10+ years of experience in IT and some close whereabouts</a
      >. I mostly do Elixir and Ruby. Based in Poznań, Poland.
    </p>

    <p>
      I might have had account on every important website at some point. Internet is my life, also
      professionally – I majored in e-business (M.Sc: "Application of OpenId in e-administration" –
      seriously, it was a thing in 2010) and law (M.Sc. in software patents), I helped establish one
      of the first e-book shops in Poland,
      <a href="http://fanpoint.com/" target="_blank">I used to click a lot on FB</a>, then I started
      to look for holes in software <a href="http://netguru.co/" target="_blank">here</a>
      <a href="http://recruitee.com/" target="_blank">and there</a>. In 2020 I finally switched my
      job to a full time backend developer. At some point I also did a couple of photo gigs as a
      <a href="https://www.facebook.com/anksfoto/" target="_blank">wedding</a> and
      <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/anksfoto/" target="_blank">amateur</a> photographer.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my free time I enjoy <a href="https://goodreads.com/matisnape" target="_blank">reading</a>,
      <a href="https://letterboxd.com/ankss/" target="_blank">watching</a>
      <a href="http://www.imdb.com/user/ur25723075" target="_blank">movies</a>, cycling (3 bikes in
      da house), running (love & hate relationship) and a random parade of handcraft stuff among the
      years.
